Bubble Sort Implementation:
A C-program that uses the bubble sort algorithm to sort numbers and letters

The program uses bubble sort with nested loops: 
Outer loop (do-while): Continues until no swaps occur 
Inner loop (for): Compares array elements next to each other and swaps them if neccessary

- Sorts numbers in ascending order
- Sorts letters in alphabetic order (case insensitive)
- Uses function pointers
- Modular design with seperate header and source files
